<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>You can access the options by choosing the option box (<a
href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/Image:Option_box.gif"
title="Image:option_box.gif"><span style='text-decoration:none'><img border=0
width=18 height=14 src="Configuration_files/image001.gif"
alt="Image:option_box.gif" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Option_box.gif"></span></a>)
next to either <b>File &gt; Open Scene</b> or <b>File &gt; Export All</b>
rather than clicking the words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a

alt="Image:maya_config_boxes.gif" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Maya_config_boxes.gif"></span></a></p>

<p>Then choose <b>NetImmerse Format</b> from the <b>File Type</b> drop down
box. If you have installed the NIF plug-in correctly, the options should appear
below. </p>

<h2>Common</h2>

<p>These settings apply to both import and export. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Use Name Mangling to Preserve Original Names</h3>

<p>This will cause characters that are invalid for Maya names to be replaced
with hex equivalents on import, and translated back to the original character
on export. Disabling it will cause all invalid characters to be changed to
underscores on import and names will be exported with no changes. </p>

<h3>Texture Search Paths</h3>

<p>This lists the paths that the plug-in will look for textures in addition to
the location of the NIF file. Each path will be searched and, if the texture is
not found in any of them, only its file name will be saved in the resulting
Maya file texture node. </p>

<p>To add a path, either type one into the text box or press <b>Browse</b> and
choose one. Once you have it the way you like it, press <b>Add</b> to insert it
at the top of the list. </p>

<p>If you want to remove a path, highlight it and press the <b>Delete</b> key. </p>

<p>You can also double-click a path to copy it back into the text box. </p>

<p>Paths can also be relative, for example, most Freedom Force NIF files have
their textures stored in a folder called &quot;textures&quot; within the folder
that the NIF file was found in. If you start your path with <b>./</b> it means
&quot;The path where the NIF file was loaded from&quot; and you can add on from
there. So to find hose Freedom Force files, you would use: <b>./textures</b> </p>

<p>Similarly, you can use <b>../</b> to mean &quot;The parent folder of the one
where the NIF was found.&quot; You can use several of these in a row to move up
multiple folders. </p>

<p>This list is also used on export if the Texture Path Adjustment mode is set
to Automatic. </p>

<h2>Import</h2>

<p>These settings apply to importing and opening NIF files. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/Image:Maya_import_options.gif"
title="Image:maya_import_options.gif"><span style='text-decoration:none'><img
border=0 width=432 height=116 src="Configuration_files/image005.gif"
alt="Image:maya_import_options.gif"
longdesc="/wiki/Image:Maya_import_options.gif"></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Attempt to Find Original Bind Pose</h3>

<p>NIF files do not store their original bind pose, but sometimes a reasonable
substitute can be calculated by trying to line up the bones with the
pre-deformed skins. Checking this activates this option. Clearing it will cause
the NIF file to import in whatever position it is actually in. </p>

<h3>Try to Use Original Normal’s</h3>

<p>Usually Maya will automatically calculate the normals of a polygon, but it
optionally supports the setting of &quot;user normals.&quot; This type of fixed
normal does not seem to work well with skins, but may allow you to retain the
original normal information from the NIF file exactly if successful. </p>

<h3>Ignore Ambient Color</h3>

<p>Most NIF files with textures have their ambient color set to white. These
cause these to be no shading on the model when rendered with Maya. Enable this
if you plan to render a NIF with textures. NIF files without textures, however,
may lose important lighting information if this enabled. </p>

<h3>Combine New Skins with Existing Skeleton</h3>

<p>This is useful when using the Import, rather than Open command. If you have
already opened or created an IK joint hierarchy, this option will cause the import
command to search for names in the NIF file which match the names in the joint
hierarchy, and use the existing joints instead of the ones in the original
file. If the original skeletons are not compatible, this may distort the
imported file or simply do nothing. </p>

<h3>Import nodes with the following in their name as joints</h3>

<p>Usually only NiNodes flagged as skin influences will be imported as IK
joints, but this will cause any with the given sub string somewhere in their
name to be imported as IK joints as well. </p>

<h2>Export</h2>

<p>These options apply to the Export All command. Export Selection is not yet
supported. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/Image:Maya_export_options.gif"
title="Image:maya_export_options.gif"><span style='text-decoration:none'><img
border=0 width=533 height=264 src="Configuration_files/image006.gif"
alt="Image:maya_export_options.gif"
longdesc="/wiki/Image:Maya_export_options.gif"></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>NIF Version</h3>

<p>This determines what version of NIF files the export process creates. If an
invalid version string is specified, the default of 4.0.0.2 is used; the lowest
NIF version that Niflib supports. </p>

<h3>Game Specific Version</h3>

<p>This used only in Oblivion so far. Set to 10 or 11 for this game. For all
other games set to zero. This might be useful in the future for other games. </p>

<h3>Export White Ambient if Texture is Present</h3>

<p>Every NIF file from a game I have seen has a white ambient component if
there is a texture present, but Maya's default is black. You can get some
interesting effects by setting the ambient color to something other than white,
but they will look very different from all the other objects in the game. </p>

<h3>Arrange Triangles in Strips</h3>

<p>This will option arranges the triangles within meshes into efficient strips.
This may cause problems in some games, but generally increases performance. </p>

<h3>Rename mesh chunks with materials with Morrowind body part names</h3>

<p>This option will scan the material names for Morrowind body part names, such
as &quot;Right Ankle&quot; or &quot;Left Upper Arm,&quot; and re-name
corresponding meshes to the proper Morrowind body part name, such as &quot;Tri
Right Ankle&quot; or &quot;Tri Left Upper Arm.&quot; This is useful if you have
a skin that is intended to cover many body parts, and you would like to keep it
in one piece. You can tag different parts of the mesh with identical, but
differently named, materials to determine which faces will become each body part.
</p>

<h3>Generate Oblivion Tangent Space Data</h3>

<p>Oblivion NIF files have some game-specific data packed into the file. This
command causes this extra data to be calculated and included in the exported
NIF file. Has no affect for other games. </p>

<h3>Maximum Number of Bones per Skin Partition</h3>

<p>Skin partitions hold skin information optimized for hardware-assisted
skinning. Depending on the shader version, there are different limits on the
number of bones that can be in each partition. 4 should always be safe, but a
limit similar to the other files in the game should provide the best
performance. All official Oblivion files seems to use a max of 20. On the other
hand, Civ4 provides two versions of each file, one with 4 bones per partition
for backwards compatibility, and one with up to 16 bones per partition for more
recent video cards. </p>

<h3>Texture Path Adjustment</h3>

<p>Most games have strict requirements about the texture image paths that must
be used in the NIF file. These options give you control over what paths written
to the file exported. </p>

<h4>Automatic based on texture search path selections</h4>

<p>When this mode enabled, the plug-in will try to intelligently guess what the
path should be. If the beginning of your texture path starts with one of the
texture search paths, the plug-in will strip that part out. So say one of your
texture search paths is <b>C:\Textures</b> and one of the file textures in your
Maya scene has a path of <b>C:\Textures\buildings\house.dds</b>. Using this
option, the resulting path in the NIF file would be <b>buildings\house.dds</b>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If none of the search paths matches the beginning of the
file's path, then only the file name will be exported. So continuing the
example above, if you did <i>not</i> have <b>C:\Textures</b> in your texture
search paths, the resulting path in the NIF file would be <b>house.dds</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Export file name only</h4>

<p>When enabled all folder, this modes will be stripped from the path, and only
the file name will be written to the NIF file. </p>

<h4>Export full path</h4>

<p>With this mode enabled, the entire path, including drive letter, all folders,
and the file name, will be written to the NIF file. </p>

<h4>Prefix file name with the following</h4>

<p>This mode allows you to specify a prefix in the following text box, which
will add to the beginning of the file name after all folders have been stripped
away. </p>

<p>For example, if you've been working a texture called <b>texture.dds</b> and
its in your My Pictures folder, but your game needs them to be prefixed with <b>textures/characters/male/</b>,
you can type that into the box and the resulting path written to the NIF file
will be <b>textures/characters/male/texture.dds</b>. </p>
