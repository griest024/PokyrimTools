The tools in this directory are part of PyFFI, but you may need to install a
few other python libraries. The easiest way to do this, is to run the
following scripts:

$ python ez_setup.py

to install setuptools, and then either

$ easy_install PyFFI

All scripts will reside in the Python
scripts folder on Windows, or in /usr/bin on linux. For NifVis you also need:

$ easy_install PyOpenGL
$ easy_install numpy
$ easy_install pygame
